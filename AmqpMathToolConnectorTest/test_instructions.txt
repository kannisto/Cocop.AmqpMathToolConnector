This application enables you to test network traffic with the
AmqpMathToolConnector library. However, to make sure the application works,
you should perform another test with the math tool (such as Matlab).

NOTE: Currently, this test does not cover automatic reconnecting.
The test assumes a secure connection (TLS). Modify the code if you want a
non-encrypted connection.


The most important modules
--------------------------

TestLogic
- implements the high-level application logic of the test

ReceptionTest
- tests if the connector can receive messages and deliver them to the math tool

SendTest
- tests if the connector can send messages


Testing data reception
----------------------

1. Run TestProgram

2. Select "r" as the mode

3. View the logs to see if the test application receives data


Testing data sending
--------------------

1. Run TestProgram

2. Select "s" as the mode

3. View the logs to see if the test application receives data
